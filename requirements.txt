Detailed Requirements for the Blog Post Listing Feature
The blog post listing feature is a core component of a blog application, designed to present a
collection of blog posts to users in an organized and visually appealing manner. The following
requirements outline the functionality and behavior expected:
-
Content Display:
-
Each blog post in the list must display the following elements:
-
Title: The headline of the blog post, prominently displayed and clickable
to navigate to the full post.
-
Summary: A brief excerpt or description of the post’s content, limited to
plain text (no HTML), approximately 50-100 words.
-
Publication Date: The date the post was published, formatted as "Month
Day, Year" (e.g.,
"January 1, 2023").
-
All three elements must be visible for each post without truncation unless
specified by design constraints.
-
Responsiveness:
-
The layout must adapt to different screen sizes:
-
Mobile Devices (up to 768px): Display the list in a single-column layout.
-
Tablet Devices (769px to 1199px): Display the list in a two-column
layout.
-
Desktop Devices (1200px and above): Display the list in a three-column
layout.
-
The transition between layouts should be seamless, with appropriate spacing
(e.g., 20px gaps between items) to maintain readability.
-
Data Handling:
-
The list will receive an array of blog post objects, each containing:
-
id: A unique identifier (string or number) for the post.
-
title: The post’s title (string).
-
summary: The post’s summary (string).
-
date: The publication date (string in ISO format, e.g.,
"2023-01-01"
, or a
Date object).
-
url: The path to the full post (string, e.g.,
"/posts/123").
-
If the array is empty, display a user-friendly message: "No blog posts available.
"
-
Interactivity:
-
The title of each post must be a clickable link that navigates to the full post using
the provided url.
-
Navigation should leverage React Router’s Link component to ensure
single-page application behavior.
-
Accessibility:
-
Use semantic HTML (e.g., <h2> for titles, <p> for summaries and dates) to
ensure compatibility with screen readers.
-
Ensure the clickable title is announced as a link by assistive technologies.
-
Styling:
-
Styles must align with the provided UI/UX designs (see below).
-
Use CSS modules to scope styles to components and prevent conflicts.
-
Apply consistent typography, colors, and spacing as specified in the designs.
-
Assumptions:
-
The parent component provides the array of blog posts as a prop; no data
fetching is required within the listing components.
-
The feature focuses on display; additional functionalities like sorting or pagination
are out of scope unless specified.
Component Structure and Architecture
The blog post listing feature is implemented using two React components: BlogPostList and
BlogPostItem. This structure separates concerns between the list container and individual
post items, promoting reusability and maintainability.
BlogPostItem Component
-
Purpose: Represents a single blog post in the list.
-
Props:
-
id (string/number): Unique identifier for the post, used as the React key.
-
title (string): The post’s title.
-
summary (string): The post’s summary text.
-
date (string/Date): The publication date.
-
url (string): The URL path to the full post.
-
Responsibilities:
-
Render the title as a clickable link using <Link> from react-router-dom.
-
Display the summary and formatted date below the title.
-
Apply styles from BlogPostItem.module.css to match the UI/UX design.
-
Example Structure:
<div className={styles.blogPostItem}>
<Link to={url} className={styles.title}><h2>{title}</h2></Link>
<p className={styles.summary}>{summary}</p>
<p className={styles.date}>Published on {formattedDate}</p>
</div>
BlogPostList Component
-
Purpose: Manages and displays the collection of blog posts.
-
Props:
-
posts (array): An array of blog post objects, each with id, title, summary,
date, and url.
-
Responsibilities:
-
Check if the posts array is empty and render "No blog posts available" if true.
-
Otherwise, map over the posts array and render a BlogPostItem for each
post.
-
Use a CSS Grid layout with media queries to adjust the number of columns
based on screen size.
-
Apply styles from BlogPostList.module.css.
-
Example Structure:
<div className={styles.blogPostList}>
{posts.map((post) => (
<BlogPostItem
key={post.id}
id={post.id}
title={post.title}
summary={post.summary}
date={post.date}
url={post.url}
/>
))}
</div>
Architecture Notes
-
Parent Component: Assumed to pass the posts array to BlogPostList. Data
fetching and state management occur outside these components.
-
Dependencies: Requires react-router-dom for the Link component.
-
File Structure:
-
BlogPostItem.js and BlogPostItem.module.css
-
BlogPostList.js and BlogPostList.module.css
UI/UX Designs for Desktop and Mobile Views
The UI/UX designs provide a visual blueprint for the blog post listing feature, specifying layouts,
typography, colors, and spacing for both desktop and mobile views.
Desktop View (1200px and above)
-
Layout:
-
Three-column grid layout.
-
Each BlogPostItem occupies one grid cell.
-
Grid gap: 20px horizontally and vertically.
-
Typography:
-
Title: <h2>, font size 24px, bold, color #333333.
-
Summary: <p>, font size 16px, regular, color #666666.
-
Date: <p>, font size 14px, regular, color #999999, prefixed with "Published on"
.
-
Styling:
-
Background: White (#FFFFFF) with a light gray border (#DDDDDD, 1px).
-
Padding inside each item: 20px.
-
Title link: No underline, color #333333, hover state changes to #007BFF (blue).
-
Dimensions:
-
Minimum column width: 300px.
-
Maximum width adjusts to fill available space equally across three columns.
Tablet View (769px to 1199px)
-
Layout:
-
Two-column grid layout.
-
Grid gap: 20px.
-
Typography and Styling:
-
Same as desktop view for consistency.
-
Dimensions:
-
Columns adjust to fill available space, with a minimum width of 300px.
Mobile View (up to 768px)
-
Layout:
-
Single-column layout.
-
Grid gap: 20px (vertical only, as items stack).
-
Typography:
-
Title: <h2>, font size 20px (slightly reduced for mobile readability).
-
Summary: <p>, font size 14px.
-
Date: <p>, font size 12px.
-
Styling:
-
Same colors and border as desktop.
-
Padding: 15px (slightly reduced for smaller screens).
-
Dimensions:
-
Full width of the screen, minus any container padding (e.g., 10px on each side).
Visual Notes
-
Consistency: Fonts should be a sans-serif family (e.g., Arial or Roboto) across all
views.
-
Spacing: Maintain 20px gaps between items unless constrained by screen size.
-
No Images: The design focuses on text-only content (title, summary, date) unless
otherwise specified.

Usage Example
To illustrate how these components work together, here’s an example of how a parent
component might use BlogPostList:
import React from 'react';
import BlogPostList from '
./BlogPostList';
const samplePosts = [
{
id: '1'
,
title: 'Getting Started with React'
,
summary: 'Learn the basics of React and build your first application.
'
,
date: '2023-01-01'
,
url: '/posts/1'
,
},
{
id: '2'
,
title: 'CSS Grid vs. Flexbox'
,
summary: 'A comparison of two powerful layout systems in CSS.
'
,
date: '2023-02-15'
,
url: '/posts/2'
,
},
{
id: '3'
,
title: 'Accessibility in Web Development'
,
summary: 'Tips for making your web applications more accessible.
'
,
date: '2023-03-10'
,
url: '/posts/3'
,
},
];
const App = () => {
return (
<div>
<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<BlogPostList posts={samplePosts} />
</div>
);
};
export default App;
